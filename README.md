# Cloudflare Integration Test PR

⚠️ **DO NOT MERGE** - This is a test pull request for demonstration purposes only.

## Purpose

This pull request is designed to demonstrate and test the Cloudflare integration for the StudySpot repository. It serves as a practical example of how pull requests interact with Cloudflare's automated deployment and review systems.

## What This PR Tests

- **Cloudflare Pages Integration**: Verifies that pull requests trigger automatic preview deployments
- **Build Process**: Ensures the C# application compiles correctly in the Cloudflare environment
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Tests the automated deployment workflow from GitHub to Cloudflare
- **PR Review Workflow**: Demonstrates how code review and feedback mechanisms work within the Cloudflare ecosystem

## Why This Exists

This test PR helps validate that:
1. Changes to the repository properly trigger Cloudflare's build and deployment systems
2. Preview URLs are generated correctly for pull request reviews
3. The integration between GitHub and Cloudflare is functioning as expected
4. Team members can review changes before they reach production

## Important Notes
